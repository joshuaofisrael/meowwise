## 2026-10-08 education campaign step 1: teachers hub, research page, Cite this page
- Opportunity: teacher and student searches ("cat worksheet for 3rd grade", "cat adaptations lesson plan", "cat facts for kids printable") plus citation friendly pages that educators, librarians and AI answer engines can recommend.
- New pages (8): /teachers/ hub (LearningResource, 7 NGSS PEs verified on nextgenscience.org: K-LS1-1, 1-LS1-2, 3-LS3-1, 4-LS1-1, 4-LS1-2, MS-LS4-5, HS-LS3-1), /teachers/cat-fact-sheet.html, /teachers/cat-worksheet-3rd-grade.html, /teachers/cat-adaptations-lesson-plan.html, /teachers/cat-quiz.html, /teachers/vocabulary.html, /research/ (CollectionPage with 19 ScholarlyArticle DOIs, every DOI checked against Europe PMC, Crossref or the publisher).
- Site wide: "Cite this page" box (APA 7, MLA 9, Chicago) and "Published / Last reviewed" line on every article, blog post, teacher page and the research page. Teachers nav item; footer links For teachers and Research; home tile. Print CSS (black on white, menus and footer extras hidden, answer keys on a new page).
- llms.txt: new "For teachers, students and researchers" section. Sitemap 29 pages plus llms.txt.
- Games: hub shows a "coming soon" note; it switches to a /games/ link automatically on the next build once games/index.html exists.
- Outreach target CSV kept local only (outreach/ is in .gitignore) because the repo is public.

## 2026-10-08 daily run: cat communication cluster plus fact article
- Data: no Search Console or analytics yet (both pending), so no query data to act on. Light run only (weekday 14:00 to 19:45 box load window).
- Highest EV action: build out the behavior and communication cluster, which already has the slow blink post. New answer first post "Do cats know their names?" (high volume question query; top results are mostly news rewrites of the 2019 study, so a page with the actual study design, numbers, the 2022 follow up and the limits adds value).
- Internal links: behavior pillar gets a "Do cats know their names?" card, the Saito 2019 source and a related link; slow blink post links to it; /research/ gains Saito 2019 and Takagi 2022 entries and the Saito 2013 entry now lists the post under Used on. Blog index description updated.
- Article sources (all opened): Saito et al. 2019 Sci Rep 9:5394 (10.1038/s41598-019-40616-4); Takagi et al. 2022 Sci Rep 12:6155 (10.1038/s41598-022-10261-5); Saito and Shinozuka 2013 Anim Cogn 16:685-690 (10.1007/s10071-013-0620-4). Details confirmed on Crossref.
- Schema: BlogPosting (publisher Joshua Israel Ventures LLC), FAQPage with 4 questions, BreadcrumbList. Sitemap 30 pages plus llms.txt.
- Live: new post HTTP 200 on meowwise.com. IndexNow (api.indexnow.org): HTTP 200 for 8 URLs (new post, behavior, slow blink, blog index, research, home, sitemap.xml, llms.txt).

## 2026-10-11 00:45 slot: fact article plus honest page dates
- Data: still no Search Console or analytics, so no query data. Light run.
- Highest EV technical fix: every page without a published key in front matter was taking the build day as its datePublished, so each rebuild made the whole site look newly published (the 9 Oct build had already moved 30 pages to 9 Oct). Pinned published (first git commit) and updated (last real edit) in front matter for all 37 source pages. Sitemap lastmod now reflects real edits (16 pages 8 Oct, 14 pages 9 Oct, 6 pages 11 Oct).
- Article: "Do cats love their owners?" (question query in the behavior cluster). Sources opened: Vitale, Behnke and Udell 2019 Current Biology 29(18):R864 to R865 (10.1016/j.cub.2019.08.036, figures checked in the article text and OSU release); Potter and Mills 2015 PLOS ONE 10(9):e0135109 (10.1371/journal.pone.0135109); Vitale Shreve, Mehrkam and Udell 2017 Behav Processes 141:322 to 328 (10.1016/j.beproc.2017.03.016). Crossref and Europe PMC abstracts checked.
- Internal links: behavior pillar card plus source plus related, names post related, three new /research/ entries, blog index description.
